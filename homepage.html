    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>Sic bo uses three dice, which are picked up by the dealer in a small chest. The dealer then uses the chest to shake the dice, until he or she is ready to reveal the combination of the three dice. If the dealer rolls the combination you wagered on, then you’re a winner.

      Sic bo revolves around a table that lists a variety of dice combinations that players are able to bet on. It is important to keep in mind that the table layout may vary from place to place, but the objective remains the same; players are able to wager on the available dice combinations listed on the table. Each combination has a certain chance of being rolled, and players must use this knowledge to help make educated decisions when placing their wagers.</p>
