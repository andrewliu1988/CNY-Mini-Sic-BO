### **Description**

My Dice roll game is a simple take on of a casino game called Sic Bo. The game has 3 dice that will produce a random # for the player to bet against. In this simple version the player only has a 8 choices they could pick from. The reason I chose this game because Chinese New Year is right around the corner. When I was a kid, I use to play a lot of casino game with my cousins during Chinese New Year because that's when we gather around and celebrate. With the pandemic going on right now I wanted to create something that could remind of my childhood. 

### **Rules** 
* **Bet** = Choose whatever you want to bet on
* **Small** = 4 to 10 When the sum of the 3 dice equals to a random value between 4 to 10. Winning ratio is 1 to 1
* **Big** = 11 to 17 When the sum of the 3 dice equals to random value between 11 to 17. Winning Ratio is 1 to 1
* **Three of a kind = High Risk High Reward** Instead of big or small your choosing if the dice is three of a kind. Three of a kind isn't count toward big or small. Winning Ration is 1 to 10   


### **Getting Started**

To get started with this project the first thing I need to do is to create and format the HTML page of the game. Creating sections, class and input to know where each and every one of the event listener is going to be. After setting up the HTML I would use simple CSS to setup the game to look like the diagram below and then we are going to move onto the javascript. 

* **Function for Random #: Dice Area** : Create a random function for each dice and the output would be the sum of all 3 dices. Random function for each dice would be min. 1 and max 6. Sum would be min. 3 and max 18
* **Function for Big and Small** : Create a function to compare the sum of the dice to big and small 
* **Function to select**: Create function that will allow us to select our big or small. 
* **Function to bet** : Allow the bet function to activate the random function of the 3 dice and determine if the player is a winner or loser. 
* **Turning the game inactive**: Player starts with $500 in the counter and once they lose all their money the game will become inactive and display player has lost all their money. 
* **Create Start Page**: Creating start page that will lead to game page. The start page will have the rules to the game. 
* **Function for Three of a kind** : creating a function that would compare equal to 3 of kind for the dice.
